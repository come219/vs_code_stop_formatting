Visual Studio Code (vscode) settings json to stop formatting

"Made it so painful to use, I made a repo for it..."


Folder of the settings.json:
C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\Code\User

Notes:
{
    1)  <user> user in path and user in should probably be the account name being used:
    "apc.imports": [
            "file:///c:/Users/user/.vscode/extensions/brandonkirbyson.vscode-animations-2.0.3/dist/updateHandler.js"
        ],

    2)  extensions that are preventing this from working properly...
